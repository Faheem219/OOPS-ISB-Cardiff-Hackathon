# NIST Special Publication 800-53 Revision 5
## Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations

### Summary

NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 provides a catalog of security and privacy controls for federal information systems and organizations. It promotes secure system development, risk management, and privacy integration.

---

## Chapter 1: Introduction

- **Purpose**: Provides a framework of controls to protect operations, assets, individuals, and the nation.
- **Applicability**: Applies to all federal information systems excluding those related to national security.
- **Audience**: Federal agencies, contractors, and other organizations managing federal data.
- **Structure**: Modular controls adaptable to organizations of varying sizes and missions.

---

## Chapter 2: The Fundamentals

- **Controls vs. Requirements**: Controls help meet requirements derived from laws, regulations, and policies.
- **Control Families**: Grouped into functional areas for security and privacy.
- **Implementation**: Tailored to system-specific needs via baselines and overlays.
- **Trustworthiness and Assurance**: Ensures systems behave predictably under stress or attack.

## Chapter 3: Control Families Overview

### 3.1 Access Control (AC)
- Policies and technologies to ensure only authorized access.
- Includes least privilege, separation of duties, and account management.

### 3.2 Awareness and Training (AT)
- Security training and awareness programs.
- Ensures personnel understand security risks and responsibilities.

### 3.3 Audit and Accountability (AU)
- Logging, monitoring, and auditing capabilities.
- Supports incident detection, investigation, and accountability.

### 3.4 Assessment, Authorization, and Monitoring (CA)
- Security assessments, system authorizations, and continuous monitoring.

### 3.5 Configuration Management (CM)
- Controls over hardware/software configurations.
- Prevents unauthorized changes.

### 3.6 Contingency Planning (CP)
- Disaster recovery and continuity plans.
- Includes backups, testing, and alternate sites.

### 3.7 Identification and Authentication (IA)
- User and device identity management.
- Supports strong authentication mechanisms.

### 3.8 Incident Response (IR)
- Incident detection, reporting, and response processes.

### 3.9 Maintenance (MA)
- System maintenance processes.
- Secure handling of repairs and diagnostics.

### 3.10 Media Protection (MP)
- Safeguards for digital and physical media.
- Includes labeling, transport, and disposal.

### 3.11 Physical and Environmental Protection (PE)
- Controls for physical access and environmental hazards.

### 3.12 Planning (PL)
- Strategic and operational planning for security and privacy.

### 3.13 Program Management (PM)
- Enterprise-wide governance and risk management policies.

### 3.14 Personnel Security (PS)
- Background checks and personnel risk assessments.

### 3.15 PII Processing and Transparency (PT)
- Privacy controls for handling personally identifiable information (PII).

### 3.16 Risk Assessment (RA)
- Identifies, evaluates, and prioritizes risks.

### 3.17 System and Services Acquisition (SA)
- Secure design, development, and acquisition practices.

### 3.18 System and Communications Protection (SC)
- Network and data security controls.
- Includes encryption, boundary protection, and integrity checks.

### 3.19 System and Information Integrity (SI)
- Error handling, monitoring, and anti-malware protections.

### 3.20 Supply Chain Risk Management (SR)
- Identifies and mitigates risks in the IT/OT supply chain.
